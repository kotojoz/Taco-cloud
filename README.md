# Taco-cloud
This repo is created during study Spring in Action 6

Small changes comparing to Original: 
- I`m not added State and Zip fields in Taco Order class
- i`m using only Spring Data Jpa in Chapter 3
- I`ll use only MySql in this project, that`s why I have skipped Chapter 4 (maybe later I`ll create another project with Mongo DB)
